# Module: External Load Balancer

## Purpose
This module will encapsulate shared infrastructure for External Load Balancer functionality in a production-grade implementation. It is intentionally a skeleton with no resources.

## Why it belongs here
Keeping this module in the shared layer preserves security boundaries and architecture consistency across environments while allowing centralized, audited configuration.
